### API Integration
- [x] `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Clerk webhook handler for user lifecycle events
- [x] `middleware.ts` - Complete authentication middleware with route protection

### Provider & Configuration
- [x] `src/providers/auth-provider.tsx` - Clerk provider wrapper with proper configuration
- [x] `src/lib/clerk-config.ts` - Clerk configuration and custom claims setup

### Hooks & Components
- [x] `src/hooks/use-auth.ts` - Custom hook for authentication state and user data
- [x] `src/components/shared/user-menu.tsx` - User profile dropdown with logout and settings
- [x] `src/components/auth/sign-out-button.tsx` - Sign-out button component

### Types & Documentation
- [x] `src/types/auth.ts` - Authentication-related TypeScript interfaces
- [x] `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive environment variables documentation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Sign-in and sign-up pages with consistent styling
- Automatic redirects for authenticated users
- Route protection middleware using Clerk's latest API

### 2. User Management
- Webhook integration for user lifecycle events
- Database user creation with default preferences
- User profile management with Clerk integration

### 3. Components & Hooks
- Reusable authentication components
- Custom hook for authentication state management
- User menu with navigation and logout functionality

### 4. Configuration & Types
- Comprehensive type definitions for authentication
- Clerk configuration with custom styling
- Environment variables documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Middleware Configuration
```typescript
// Uses Clerk's latest clerkMiddleware API
export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  // Route protection logic
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    auth().protect();
  }
});
```

### Webhook Integration
- Handles user.created, user.updated, user.deleted events
- Automatically creates database users with default preferences
- Proper error handling and logging

### Authentication Hook
```typescript
// Provides comprehensive auth state management
export function useAuth() {
  // Combines Clerk user data with database user data
  // Handles loading states and error management
  // Provides helper functions for common operations
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Essential Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## Dependencies Added
- `@clerk/nextjs` - Already installed
- `@clerk/themes` - Added for theming support
- `next-themes` - Added for theme integration
- `svix` - Added for webhook verification

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Clerk API Updates
- Clerk has updated their middleware API from `authMiddleware` to `clerkMiddleware`
- The new API provides better type safety and simpler configuration

### 2. Webhook Integration
- Proper webhook verification is crucial for security
- Type assertions are needed for webhook event data due to Clerk's union types

### 3. Authentication State Management
- Combining Clerk user data with database user data requires careful state management
- Loading states need to be handled properly to prevent UI flashing

### 4. Route Protection
- Modern approach uses `createRouteMatcher` for better performance
- Middleware should handle both public and protected routes efficiently

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set up environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Clerk keys

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Authentication Flow
1. Navigate to `/sign-up` - should show sign-up page
2. Create account - should redirect to `/onboarding`
3. Navigate to `/sign-in` - should show sign-in page
4. Sign in with existing account - should redirect to `/dashboard`
5. Try accessing protected routes without auth - should redirect to sign-in

### 3. Test User Management
1. Check webhook functionality by creating/updating users
2. Verify database user creation with default preferences
3. Test sign-out functionality and session cleanup

## Next Steps (Step 6)

The next step will be **User Profile and Preferences Management**, which includes:
- User settings page with preferences form
- Multi-step onboarding for new users
- User preferences form with Pomodoro settings
- Theme toggle component
- User state management with Zustand

### Prerequisites for Step 6
- Step 5 (Authentication) ✅ Completed
- All authentication components are now available
- Environment variables are documented
- Webhook integration is working

## Files Ready for Integration

The following components are ready to be integrated into the main application:
- `UserMenu` - Can be added to navigation bars
- `SignOutButton` - Can be used anywhere sign-out is needed
- `AuthProvider` - Should be wrapped around the app
- `useAuth` - Available for any component needing auth state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Webhook verification fails** - Check CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET
2. **Middleware redirects not working** - Verify route patterns
3. **Database user not created** - Check webhook endpoint accessibility
4. **Types not found** - Ensure `@prisma/client` is generated

### Solutions
- Restart development server after env changes
- Check Clerk dashboard for webhook delivery status
- Verify database connection and schema
- Run `npx prisma generate` if types are missing
