**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Started**: July 10, 2025  
**Completed**: TBD

## Implementation Details

### Task Description
Create the core design system with typography, colors, spacing, and base UI components following the specification's design guidelines.

### Files to Create/Modify (14 files)
- [ ] `src/app/globals.css` - TailwindCSS imports and custom CSS variables for design tokens
- [ ] `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Primary, secondary, and timer button variants with proper animations
- [ ] `src/components/ui/input.tsx` - Standard, timer, and search input components with validation states
- [ ] `src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Card component with elevation and hover animations
- [ ] `src/components/ui/modal.tsx` - Modal component with backdrop, animations, and accessibility features
- [ ] `src/components/ui/toast.tsx` - Toast notification component for user feedback
- [ ] `src/components/ui/progress.tsx` - Progress bar component for timer and analytics displays
- [ ] `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component for tags, achievements, and status indicators
- [ ] `src/components/ui/avatar.tsx` - User avatar component with fallback states
- [ ] `src/components/ui/dropdown.tsx` - Dropdown menu component for actions and selections
- [ ] `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Loading skeleton components for better UX
- [ ] `src/components/ui/index.ts` - Barrel export for all UI components
- [ ] `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions for className merging, formatting, and common operations
- [ ] `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with proper HTML structure, fonts, and global providers

## Prerequisites
- Step 1 must be completed (Next.js project initialized)

## Implementation Progress

### Current Progress
Starting implementation of design system foundation. Basic CSS foundation is already in place from Step 1.

### Next Actions
1. ✅ Set up global CSS with design tokens (Already completed in Step 1)
2. Implement base UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
3. Create utility functions (className merging, formatting)
4. Update root layout with proper providers

## Lessons Learned
- TBD

## Todo/Notes
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all components
- Test components in both light and dark modes
- Verify responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Set up proper TypeScript types for component props

## Dependencies
- Step 1: Project Foundation & Setup ✅

## Testing Instructions
Verify design system by viewing storybook-style examples in the development environment.
