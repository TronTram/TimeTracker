# Implementation Guidelines

## Development Approach
- Proceed one step at a time following the implementation plan
- Complete each step thoroughly before moving to the next
- Maintain high code quality and follow established patterns

## Documentation Requirements
When each step is completed:

1. **Mark it done** in the progress tracker
2. **Create a step log** in `.ai/step-logs/step-XX-name.md` containing:
   - **Implementation details**: What was built and how
   - **Lessons learned**: Key insights, challenges, and solutions
   - **Todo items**: Follow-up tasks and improvements needed
   - **Code references**: Important files and functions created

See `.ai/README.md` for complete documentation overview.
