As a meticulous Git expert and senior software engineer, I need your assistance to craft a comprehensive Git commit based on my current unstaged changes.

Carefully analyze the provided Git diff output:

<git-diff>
  use git dif
</git-diff>

Based on these modifications, please provide the following two outputs:

### 1. Professional Git Commit Message

Craft a concise, clear, and descriptive Git commit message adhering to professional standards. Your commit message must:

* Clearly state **what changes** were made.
* Briefly explain **why these changes** were made (their purpose).
* Mention explicitly **what issue they resolve or new functionality they introduce**.

#### Context for Changes:

\[Briefly describe the overall purpose of these changes here, e.g., "These changes implement the new user registration flow," or "These modifications fix a critical bug in the payment processing module."]

### 2. Impacted File Paths

Provide a bulleted list of file paths (relative to the repository root) directly affected by these changes. Ensure only files directly relevant to the described purpose are included.

Once done, please run git add command to stage these files
