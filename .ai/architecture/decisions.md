# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document tracks key architectural decisions made during the development of the Cursor Time Tracker application.

## ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

**Date**: Project Inception
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to choose a modern React framework for the time tracking application

**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and initial load performance
- App Router provides better file-based routing and layouts
- Built-in optimization features (image optimization, code splitting)
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Strong ecosystem and community support

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Great developer experience, performance optimization out-of-the-box
- Negative: Learning curve for App Router vs Pages Router
- Positive: Better core web vitals scores

## ADR-002: Styling Approach

**Date**: Project Setup
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to choose a styling solution that's maintainable and performant

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with custom design system
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Built-in responsive design utilities
- Excellent tree-shaking and optimization
- Easy to maintain consistent design tokens
- Great integration with VS Code and development tools

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Fast development, consistent spacing/colors
- Negative: Large class names in JSX
- Positive: Smaller final bundle size due to purging

## ADR-003: Database and ORM Selection

**Date**: Database Setup Phase
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need a robust database solution with type safety

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL: Reliable, feature-rich, excellent JSON support
- Prisma: Type-safe database access, excellent migration system
- Strong integration between Prisma and TypeScript
- Prisma Studio for database administration
- Support for both local development and cloud deployment

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Type safety, great developer experience
- Negative: Additional abstraction layer over SQL
- Positive: Automated migrations and schema management

## ADR-004: Authentication Provider

**Date**: Authentication Implementation
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need secure, feature-rich authentication system

**Decision**: Clerk Authentication
**Rationale**:
- Complete authentication solution out-of-the-box
- Support for multiple auth providers (email, social login)
- Built-in user management dashboard
- Excellent Next.js integration
- Webhooks for user lifecycle events
- Free tier sufficient for development and early users

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Rapid implementation, enterprise-grade security
- Negative: Vendor lock-in, potential costs at scale
- Positive: Reduced security maintenance burden

## ADR-005: State Management Strategy

**Date**: Client-Side State Architecture
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need state management for timer, UI state, and user preferences

**Decision**: Zustand for client state + Server Actions for data mutations
**Rationale**:
- Zustand: Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly, minimal boilerplate
- Server Actions: Built into Next.js, progressive enhancement
- Clear separation between client UI state and server data
- No need for complex state management (Redux) for this use case

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Simple, maintainable state management
- Positive: Leverages Next.js built-in features
- Negative: Less ecosystem than Redux for complex scenarios

## ADR-006: Component Architecture

**Date**: UI Component Design
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need scalable component architecture

**Decision**: Radix UI primitives + Custom design system components
**Rationale**:
- Radix UI: Accessible, unstyled component primitives
- Custom components: Brand consistency and specific needs
- Headless UI approach allows full design control
- Excellent keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Consequences**:
- Positive: High accessibility standards, custom design
- Negative: More initial setup than pre-built component libraries
- Positive: Full control over styling and behavior

## ADR-007: Data Fetching Strategy

**Date**: Server Integration
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need efficient data fetching and caching

**Decision**: Next.js Server Components + Server Actions + React Query patterns
**Rationale**:
- Server Components: Reduced client bundle, better performance
- Server Actions: Type-safe mutations, progressive enhancement
- Leverage Next.js caching mechanisms
- Reduced complexity compared to traditional REST + React Query setup

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Better performance, simpler data flow
- Negative: Newer patterns, less community examples
- Positive: Built-in caching and revalidation

## ADR-008: Timer Implementation Architecture

**Date**: Core Timer Design
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need accurate, reliable timer with persistence

**Decision**: Web Workers + Local Storage + Server Sync
**Rationale**:
- Web Workers: Accurate timing independent of main thread
- Local Storage: Persist timer state across browser sessions
- Server Sync: Backup and cross-device synchronization
- Page Visibility API: Handle tab switching behavior

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Accurate timing, works offline, persistent
- Negative: Additional complexity for worker communication
- Positive: Better user experience across sessions

## ADR-009: Deployment and Hosting

**Date**: Deployment Planning
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need reliable, scalable hosting solution

**Decision**: Vercel for frontend + Supabase for database
**Rationale**:
- Vercel: Excellent Next.js integration, global CDN, automatic deployments
- Supabase: Managed PostgreSQL, real-time features, good free tier
- Both have generous free tiers for development
- Easy scaling path for production usage

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Minimal DevOps overhead, excellent performance
- Negative: Vendor dependence for both frontend and database
- Positive: Built-in monitoring and analytics

## ðŸ“‹ Decision Status Legend

- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision
