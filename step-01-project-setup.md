## Prerequisites
None

## Implementation Progress

### Current Progress
✅ Project fully initialized and configured
✅ All dependencies installed successfully
✅ TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path aliases
✅ TailwindCSS configured with custom design system
✅ ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
✅ Build system working correctly
✅ Basic app structure created

### Next Actions
Ready to proceed to Step 2: Design System Foundation

## Lessons Learned
- Next.js config needed to be in CommonJS format (module.exports) rather than ES modules
- All major dependencies are compatible and installed successfully
- TypeScript strict mode configuration works well with path aliases
- TailwindCSS custom design tokens are properly configured
- Build process completes successfully

## Todo/Notes
- ✅ All dependencies compatible and working
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode configured
- ✅ Path aliases working for clean imports
- ✅ Development environment ready

## Dependencies
None (foundational step)

## Testing Instructions
✅ Run `npm install` to install dependencies - COMPLETED
✅ Run `npm run build` to verify build process - COMPLETED
✅ TypeScript compilation working - VERIFIED

## Verification Results
- ✅ Dependencies installed without conflicts
- ✅ Build process completes successfully  
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ Project structure properly created
- ✅ Configuration files all working
